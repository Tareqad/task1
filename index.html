<p>hello 
    My name is Tariq Adwan, and I’m 28 years old.
     I graduated with a degree in accounting in 2022,
     but early this year, I decided to embark on a new path by studying programming.
     My interest in programming stems from its dynamic and ever-evolving nature.
     Unlike other fields, programming keeps the mind sharp with continuous learning and adaptation, offering something new to discover at every turn.
     It’s an area filled with innovative and competitive minds, which drives my motivation to grow and excel.
     The challenges, creativity, and intelligence required in programming make it a field I’m passionate about pursuing.
